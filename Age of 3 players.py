First line of the input is an integer that corresponds to the total age of the 3 players.
Output format:
Output should display the ages of the three players in 3 lines. The age of the eldest player should be displayed in the last line.
Sample input and output 1:
70
20
20
30
Sample input and output 2:
100
30
30
40
7)
You are given principal amount, rate of interest per annum, and time in years. You need to calculate the simple interest.
Input and Output Format
Input Format:
The first line contains the principal amount (principal).
The second line contains the rate of interest (rate) per annum.
The third line contains the time (time) in years.
Output Format:
A single line containing the simple interest calculated.
